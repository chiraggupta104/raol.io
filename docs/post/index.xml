      <title>Poor man language identification.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Language identification, as it&amp;rsquo;s easy to guess, is the task of identifying the language
of a document. For instance search engines may store the language of the indexed document
and provide option such as &lt;em&gt;Search for English results only&lt;/em&gt; as Google does. But in order
to store the language, engine should determine it first.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s a pleasure to abandon that very-cool-enterprise development, to
take some book on algorithms and to solve couple of problems from it. Just to keep
brain if not sharp, but at least not rusty. Also diving in some problem of that kind
is the nice way to resurrect old math skills I was taught in the university.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Logging with log4net in Azure</title>
      <link>http://raol.io/post/logging-with-log4net-in-azure/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Though you can configure basic logging for Azure using built in
&lt;a href=&#34;http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cloud-services-dotnet-diagnostics/&#34;&gt;diagnostic tools&lt;/a&gt;
sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to have more control on logging. So it might be a good idea
to use log4net on top of the azure diagnostics and configure it to fit all your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m exploring and trying to learn Haskell, or at least get better understanding of
functional programming. So I thought it would be interesting to tease the brain
and reimplement some of Haskell parts in my &amp;ldquo;mother tongue&amp;rdquo; C#.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Machine Learning in Azure. Publishing.</title>
      <link>http://raol.io/post/machine-learning-in-azure-publishing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;http://raol.io/2014/07/21/machine-learning-in-azure/&#34;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; post I explained how to create new
Azure machine learning experiment and how to use linear regression to make predictions.
The experiment is pretty cool itself as any other one, but there is one minor problem with it.
It&amp;rsquo;s totally useless. Oh, you certainly can open it up and run all steps manually each time you need
to predict profit (I&amp;rsquo;m still talking about previous post with synthetic experiment and synthetic dataset)
based on city population, but, agree, it&amp;rsquo;s not very suitable. It would be nice if you had a way
to store your trained model and supply data you need to analyze, and get back results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a really long pause between this post and previous one, but I hope to get pace and write more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time we will review new Azure Machine Learning service that was announced recently and will solve that &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo;
linear regression task (from my previous posts) using the ML service.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since the last post was written. So it&amp;rsquo;s time to create new one. I know, I promised to explain
how to choose $ \alpha $ parameter and why it matters, but not this time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Machine learning with python. Linear regression. Part 2</title>
      <link>http://raol.io/post/machine-learning-with-python-linear-regression-part-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the first article on linear regression I promised to show how to do it better,
so this post will be about truly scientific approach to the problem. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you
don&amp;rsquo;t get it off hand. Honestly speaking it took some time for me to figure out what&amp;rsquo;s going on
and even now from time to time I take some paper and draw matrices/vectors to be sure I&amp;rsquo;m doing
everything right.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay. There were tons of typos in my previous post, despite all reviews and fixes. So if something can be done automatically, it should be done automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Machine learning with Python. Linear regression. Part 1</title>
      <link>http://raol.io/post/machine-learning-with-python-linear-regression-part-1/</link>

      <guid>http://raol.io/post/machine-learning-with-python-linear-regression-part-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m taking cool &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/course/ml&#34;&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt; class at Coursera, so to get better understanding of the material,
decided to write a series of blog posts about it. As it clear from the post title, I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain what linear regression is and how it works.
I don&amp;rsquo;t like to read long-long posts because somewhere in the middle I can&amp;rsquo;t get rid of feeling that the beginning of the post became vague and most of
facts were forgotten. So it&amp;rsquo;s going to be short and painless.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ASCII Art With Python</title>
      <link>http://raol.io/post/ascii-art-with-python/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was always curious about creating cool ASCII &amp;ldquo;pictures&amp;rdquo; from actual images and finally decided to figure out how to do it.
It&amp;rsquo;s fairly simple. What we need to do is to resize image to fit in ASCII console (120 columns) keeping it&amp;rsquo;s original ratio.
Then convert it to greyscale and map grey level to ASCII symbol.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blogging with GitHub pages and Jekyll</title>

      <description>Okay. This is going to be another article about GitHub pages, Jekyll and how to start blogging using theese cool tools. There are plenty of manuals about the topic, but since I&amp;rsquo;m windows user and spent some time trying to set up everything I&amp;rsquo;m going to describe the process from the very beginning.
Creating GitHub pages First of all you need to create a site using GitHub pages. Go to the http://github.</description>
